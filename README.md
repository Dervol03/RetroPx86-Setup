RetroPx86-Setup
==============

What is RetroPx86-Setup?
------------------------

RetroPx86-Setup is a fork of the awesome work done by _petrockblog_, unifying many emulators under the emulationstation project. It's main purpose is to use the great scripts and interface _petrockblog_ has created to make the whole systen run on a normal x86 based distribution of Ubuntu/Debian.

Why even porting it to x86 architecture and normal distributions??
------------------------------------------------------------------

The main reason for it is that I was really enthusiastic about this project, but had to realize that the limitations of my RaspberryPi, not performing well with playstation and N64 games. So I decided to give it a shot to reuse this awesome project on platforms that can provide the necesary power to also handle future additions (PS2, Xbox).

General Usage
-------------

As the project is not ready for a stable release yet, I recommend to use RetroPie-Setup for the moment. See [patrockblogs RetroPie-Setup](https://github.com/petrockblog/RetroPie-Setup) and his very good [project blog with more details](http://blog.petrockblock.com/2012/07/22/retropie-setup-an-initialization-script-for-retroarch-on-the-raspberry-pi/)
